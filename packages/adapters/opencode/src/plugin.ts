/**
 * OpenCode plugin entry point for `@weave/adapter-opencode`.
 *
 * This module exports the `Plugin` function that OpenCode loads at startup
 * when `@weave/adapter-opencode` is listed in the `plugin` array of
 * `opencode.json`. It is the primary runtime integration surface between
 * Weave and OpenCode.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * 1. OpenCode calls the exported `server` function (the `Plugin`) with a
 *    `PluginInput` context that includes a pre-constructed SDK client and the
 *    project directory.
 * 2. The plugin loads the Weave config from `input.directory` via
 *    `loadConfig()`.
 * 3. It calls `materializeAgents()` to compose all agent descriptors from the
 *    resolved config.
 * 4. It translates each descriptor into an `OpenCodeAgentConfig` via
 *    `translateAgent()` and collects the results into a `translatedMap`.
 * 5. It returns a `Hooks` object **immediately** with two hooks:
 *    a. **`config` hook** — injects the translated agent configs into
 *       `cfg.agent` so that `opencode debug config` reflects all Weave-managed
 *       agents. This runs once at startup before OpenCode finalises its config.
 *    b. **`event` hook** — listens for the first `session.created` event and
 *       then performs SDK-backed reconciliation (`adapter.init()` +
 *       `spawnSubagent()`) exactly once per plugin activation. This defers the
 *       SDK/DB path to real session time, so `opencode debug config` is never
 *       blocked by runtime SDK calls.
 *
 * ## Why deferred SDK reconciliation?
 *
 * `opencode debug config` calls the plugin function and waits for `Hooks` to
 * be returned. In the previous design, `adapter.init()` and `spawnSubagent()`
 * were called eagerly before `Hooks` was returned. Both operations touch the
 * OpenCode SDK / DB path (`client.app.agents()`, `config.update()`), which
 * hangs in the `debug config` context because the runtime store is not
 * available.
 *
 * The fix: config loading and agent translation are pure computation (no SDK
 * calls). `Hooks` is returned immediately after translation. SDK reconciliation
 * is deferred to the `event` hook, which only fires during a real OpenCode
 * session — never during `debug config`.
 *
 * ## Why both paths?
 *
 * The `config` hook and the SDK-backed reconciliation serve different purposes:
 *
 * - The `config` hook makes agents visible to `opencode debug config` and to
 *   any OpenCode subsystem that reads the merged config at startup. It is
 *   purely additive — it does not persist agents across restarts.
 * - The SDK-backed reconciliation (`spawnSubagent`) writes agents into
 *   OpenCode's runtime store via `client.config.update()`. This is the
 *   durable path that survives config reloads and is the source of truth for
 *   what OpenCode actually uses at runtime.
 *
 * Both paths are required for full materialization: the `config` hook for
 * observability and startup-time config visibility, and the SDK path for
 * runtime persistence and ownership-safe upsert.
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * Add `@weave/adapter-opencode/plugin` to the `plugin` array in `opencode.json`.
 * Use the subpath export — **not** the bare package name:
 *
 * ```jsonc
 * // opencode.json
 * {
 *   "plugin": ["@weave/adapter-opencode/plugin"]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The bare `@weave/adapter-opencode` entry (`dist/index.js`) exports non-function
 * values (constants, type re-exports) that cause OpenCode's `getLegacyPlugins`
 * loader to throw `TypeError: Plugin export is not a function`. This module
 * (`dist/plugin.js`) exports only the plugin function and is the correct entry
 * point for OpenCode.
 *
 * Restart OpenCode after adding the plugin. The plugin entry point receives
 * the runtime context, constructs an `OpenCodeAdapter` with the injected SDK
 * client, and materializes all agents declared in `.weave/config.weave`.
 *
 * ## Boundary rules
 *
 * - The plugin entry point is the only place that imports from
 *   `@opencode-ai/plugin`. All other adapter modules remain plugin-agnostic.
 * - The `PluginInput.client` is injected into `SdkOpenCodeClient` — the
 *   adapter never constructs its own SDK client.
 * - Config loading and agent materialization follow the same path as any
 *   other adapter consumer: `loadConfig → materializeAgents → spawnSubagent`.
